"""DGN-1683: turn mute after the mint verb already delivered the owner screen.

THE DEFECT (live 2026-09-24 16:23, dev.44). Owner asked for a new agent; the
agent called the mint verb (`open`), the verb pushed the catalog screen to
Telegram itself and returned `screen_delivered: true` /
`note_for_agent: "SCREEN_SENT_END_TURN"`. The agent then ALSO ended the turn
with prose ("No active flow, so open a new one.\n(...)") -- English internal
reasoning plus a narration of the rule. The mint SKILL says "add nothing";
that is a rule the MODEL executes, and the first live use proved the model
does not reliably execute it. This module is the forcing point.

THE CONTRACT. The verdict is read from the verb's own tool_result JSON --
never from prose -- and only for a main-agent Bash call whose command runs
the verb (`mint_flow.sh` / `mint_flow.py`):

    screen_delivered true OR note SCREEN_SENT_END_TURN  -> MUTE_SCREEN
        the owner-bound text of the turn is suppressed (nothing is sent)
    agent_utterance "N13"                               -> MUTE_N13
        the owner-bound text is exactly N13_SENTENCE, nothing else
    anything else / no verb call                        -> no verdict,
        the turn is untouched

A verdict latches for the rest of the turn; MUTE_SCREEN outranks MUTE_N13
(once a screen is on the owner's phone, the fallback sentence would
contradict it).

N13 policy: when the agent produced ANY owner-bound text in an N13 turn, the
owner receives exactly N13_SENTENCE -- extra text is cut, a paraphrase is
replaced. Suppressing instead would leave the owner with neither a screen
nor a notice after a delivery failure, the one case the fallback exists for;
the sentence is fixed approved copy, so emitting it can never leak. When the
agent said nothing, nothing is sent: the bridge never speaks on its own.

DGN-1849 (dec-243): the onboarding verb (routines/onboarding-screen.py)
follows the same contract -- it sends the fixed onboarding screens (Q1-Q5,
kit offer) itself and returns the same result keys, so a call to it mutes
the turn exactly like a mint verb call. It also returns
SCREEN_UNCERTAIN_END_TURN when Telegram may already hold the screen: that
mutes too (a second, model-written copy of the question is worse than none).
It never emits N13.

PROVISIONAL HOLD (pre-verb gap, live 2026-10-04). The CLI streams each
content block of one API message as its own assistant event, so narration
written BEFORE the verb call ("Run open without --fit first ...") arrives in
a text-only event and the same-message rule cannot see the call yet. A turn
that loads the mint skill or calls a verb (arms_hold) therefore holds all
later owner-bound text until the turn ends: a verdict discards it, no verdict
releases it unchanged (sdk_bridge._settle_mint_held).

N13_SENTENCE is a lockstep copy of the OWNER-SAY block in the mint-agent
SKILL.md (tests/test_dgn1683_mint_screen_mute.py pins the two together).
Stdlib-only; no telegram / SDK imports.
