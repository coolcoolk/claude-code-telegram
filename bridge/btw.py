"""DGN-902: /btw fork -- ephemeral side conversation.

Forks the current main session context into an isolated SDK client using
ClaudeAgentOptions(fork_session=True, resume=<session_id>). The fork:
  - READ: inherits the full session history up to the fork point.
  - WRITE: writes to its own new session ID, never to the main session.

Fork state is keyed by the message_id of the 💭 bubble sent in reply.
Subsequent user messages that reply to any known fork bubble are routed
into that fork's session instead of the main session history.

# history (multi-MB for a long-lived session) + the model call on that full
# context, and kept exceeding 120s (also documented in the DGN-953 fork-leak
# test), so every /btw on a heavy session died as BTW_FORK_FAILED. A fork

    receive_messages() yields every frame on the transport, but a forked or
    resumed session can run turns the bridge never asked for: Claude Code
    auto-enqueues the resumed session's pending background-task notifications
    as inputs at CLI startup, opens a turn for each, and emits a ResultMessage
    per turn. Measured live (bot.log 2026-09-08 18:47:58 + fork transcript
    45822502): the notification was enqueued 20ms before the bridge's
    question, its turn was coalesced away with zero assistant output, and its
    ResultMessage reached the reader FIRST -- the old unconditional break
    adopted it as the answer, told the user the side question failed, and the
    real answer streamed into a reader that had already returned.

    A result frame is stray exactly when the model has said nothing yet in
    this read (assistant_msgs == 0) and the result is not an error. Both
    other shapes keep the old contract: an error result is an honest failure
    and ends the read; a result after any AssistantMessage is our turn's
    boundary (genuine empty answers stay instant). The skip is bounded by the
    caller's BTW_TURN_TIMEOUT wait_for, so a stream that only ever produces
    stray results still ends at the timeout and reaps at the DGN-1343 gate.
