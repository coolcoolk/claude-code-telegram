# DGN-919: single source of truth for the slash-command menu.
# Order here drives BOTH the BotCommand popup menu AND the /help numbered list.
# Hidden commands must NOT appear here.  Accurate per-command status:
#   /start     -- CommandHandler registered in _setup_handlers, off-menu.
#   /usageretry -- CommandHandler registered in _setup_handlers, off-menu.
#   /claim     -- NO CommandHandler; intercepted by _check_access via the
#                 MODE_CLAIM ownership path (catch-all _handle_claim_attempt).
#                 A post-ownership "/claim x" falls through to the catch-all
#                 MessageHandler and is forwarded to the model as a slash cmd.
#   kill       -- no handler at all; must not appear anywhere.
#   /authsync  -- RETIRED (DGN-1050): its file->keychain overwrite re-injected
#                 superseded refresh tokens after CLI runtime rotations and
#                 killed the whole estate's auth. A hidden CommandHandler stub
#                 remains registered (off-menu) solely so a typed /authsync is
#                 answered with the retirement notice instead of being
#                 forwarded to the SDK session by the catch-all. It can never
#                 write credentials. Must NOT reappear in this menu.
#   /health    -- DGN-986 D1 owner amendment (2026-08-21): "authsync 다음,
#                 help 앞" (after authsync, before help). authsync was
#                 retired from this menu by DGN-1050 AFTER D1 was decided,
#                 so the literal anchor ("after authsync") no longer exists
#                 in this list -- this merge (DGN-986 integration) places
#                 health immediately before help, preserving the half of D1
#                 that is still satisfiable ("help 앞"/before help) and the
#                 DGN-997/DGN-1050 ordering as landed on main. NOT re-run
#                 past the owner -- flagged for confirmation.
# First contact after /claim (rehearsal 2026-10-02): the claim no longer
# answers with a fixed ownership line; it opens the agent's own first turn so
# the very first bubble is the agent introducing itself. Model-facing turn
# text, not owner copy: it states what happened and defers WHAT to say to the
# agent's first-contact rules (persona onboarding block / onboarding-check.py)
# -- no example sentences here by rule.
# DGN-1842: the turn also restates the opener constraints the host's opener
# Stop gate (DGN-1837) enforces, so the first draft passes and no blocked
# draft is generated at all. Rules only, no wording.
# DGN-1848: the identity is a personal agent with no owner possessive -- a
# possessive identity plus the pronoun ban made the model invent a
# substitute possessive (rehearsal 2026-10-04).

# CHANGELOG, releases/, worklog tickets, the OSS mirror) found the constant

# introduced or justified it -- only downstream code that ASSUMES it
# (DGN-841 / DGN-922 / DGN-966 / DGN-1050 comments below). What it actually
# protects today is narrow: process first boot already drops every queued
# update Telegram-side (start_polling drop_pending_updates=first_boot), so
# this gate only covers updates replayed on an IN-PROCESS polling
# re-establish (network loss / laptop sleep-wake).
# It is a poor fit for CALLBACK updates: a notification button is normally
# tapped hours later (measured 2026-09-10: 5 h 57 m), and the age it measures

        Contract: one restart tap = exactly ONE terminal notification to the
        owner (complete or failed), never silence. The completion push is
        normally owned by the detached self_restart.sh worker; that worker is
        a single point of failure (2026-08-22 08:00: it was reaped with the
        old bridge's process group and the owner's CTA tap ended in silence).

        A restart, by construction, always brings up a NEW bridge process --
        so this process is the second leg. The worker arms
        <bot_data_dir>/state/restart-pending.marker just before severing the
        old bridge and CLAIMS it (atomic rename) before its own terminal
        push. Here: if the marker is present and the worker pid recorded in
        it is dead, the worker can never push -- claim the marker ourselves
        and terminal-close the restart. The rename is the mutex: exactly one
        of {worker, backstop} wins, so no duplicate notice is possible.

        Lifecycle: one task per polling start, cancelled with the sibling
        tasks. Normal boots (no marker) exit after a single check. A live
        worker (e.g. long --verify) keeps ownership -- we just keep waiting.

        """DGN-1050: /authsync is RETIRED. This stub only explains why.

        The original command (DGN-759) ran token-sync.sh, whose `sync`
        subcommand unconditionally overwrote the macOS Keychain entry from
        ~/.claude/.credentials.json. The Claude CLI keeps the keychain copy
        authoritative and does NOT rewrite the file after runtime token
        rotations, so the file is stale BY DESIGN -- the overwrite re-injected
        superseded refresh tokens, the server revoked the token family on
        reuse, and every instance sharing the account died (~daily).

        The only safe credential writer is the CLI itself
        (`claude auth login` in a plain terminal). This handler therefore:
          - spawns NO subprocess and touches NO credential store, ever;
          - replies with the retirement notice pointing to the correct
            procedure;
          - stays registered off-menu ONLY so the catch-all skill forwarder
            cannot ship a typed /authsync into the SDK session (where a model
            could otherwise be talked into running the retired skill script).

        The DGN-994 sync-ok restart CTA died with the sync path; /restart
        (DGN-997) is the surviving restart surface.

        Fills a missing command-line surface: DGN-994 wired a restart CTA
        only inside the /authsync sync-ok reply (a button, not a command),
        so the general-purpose "just restart" path had no slash entry at
        all -- an agent ended up announcing a non-existent /restart to the
        owner (DGN-997 incident).

        Owner gate: same _check_access() every other command uses -- no new
        permission logic. An explicit /restart typed by the owner IS the
        explicit restart command (AGENT.md Self-restart: an owner trigger
        skips the idle guard entirely, immediate, no confirmation menu),
        the same convention DGN-994's CTA tap already uses, so this reuses
        that exact call shape: --trigger user, no --resume-intent.

        --resume-intent intentionally omitted: --resume-intent exists for a
        caller that KNOWS the specific in-flight task it is cutting off
        (e.g. an agent restarting itself mid-fix, session-side). This handler
        is a bridge-process command entry point -- it has no visibility
        into what the live SDK session is doing at the moment the owner
        types /restart, and guessing would violate the "no hunting
        chronically-open wip tickets" contract self_restart.sh already
        documents for the omitted case. Omitting the flag is the correct
        "no specific in-flight task asserted" signal (self_restart.sh's own
        contract), not a gap -- the resumed session's DGN-226 post-restart
        self-verification step covers anything actually cut off.

        Progress/completion notice: self_restart.sh owns the completion push
        on its own (default fallback copy when no --notice is passed, see
        self_restart.sh DGN-687/834). dec-094 adds a synchronous immediate
        ack (RESTART_ACK) right after the launch subprocess returns 0, so
        /restart is not silent for the ~6s SIGTERM window before that

        contract (formatting.py:950-954) forbids feeding it a raw code
        fence, so the split MUST happen before either renderer runs.

        Shared by _send_text_body / _send_text_body_chat (model-turn sends,
        fast-path body) and _idrill_post_followup (idrill followup_cmd
        STDOUT, DGN-1076) so every path honors the same contract and
        renders identically.

        DGN-1209: this is the bot-side CHOKE POINT for the machine-line gate
        (the other is formatting.sanitize_message_for_telegram). The gate runs
        on the raw pre-render text, before the fence split. `rail` is the
        caller's declaration (RAIL_CONSUMER / RAIL_MODEL); an undeclared
        caller gets RAIL_UNKNOWN and its alerts say so.
