"""DGN-1586 notice spool -- consumer/receipt side of the owner-notice
delivery accounting.

CONTRACT (DGN-1586 hardened spec, sections 3.1/3.4/3.5/3.6/5):

- The spool is the instance file .telegram_bot/state/notice-spool.jsonl,
  one JSON record per line. The PRODUCER side (routines/version-check.py,
  a standalone stdlib-only SessionStart hook that must not import bridge/)
  implements the SAME record schema and locking protocol independently --
  the shared contract is the FILE + LOCK protocol, not shared code (the
  established footer-sidecar precedent: status-footer.py writes, the
  bridge reads, no import either way). Any schema change here must land
  in version-check.py in the same change, and vice versa.

- Locking (spec MINOR-3): every read-modify-write runs under an exclusive
  flock on the SEPARATE fixed lock file .telegram_bot/state/
  notice-spool.lock; the jsonl itself is replaced atomically
  (tmp + os.replace) so a reader never sees a torn file. Network calls
  never happen inside the lock.

- Record statuses: pending -> delivered (real send receipt) or
  expired (reason: resolved / superseded / attempts_exhausted).
  "delivered" is owned EXCLUSIVELY by the send/edit success of the
  message that actually carried the notice text (spec 3.6) -- never by
  ChatResponse completion, first-segment success, or a stream draft.

- Corrupt lines are preserved verbatim on rewrite and logged (spec 5:
  valid rows survive, parse failures become diagnostics; repair is
  operator-owned).

This module is deliberately dependency-light: stdlib + lazy bridge
imports only, and every path parameter is explicit so tests can point it
at a scratch instance root.
