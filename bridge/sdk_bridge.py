#
# v2 STRENGTH (DGN-686, direction lock 2026-08-02) = DROP-ONLY. The bridge
# guard does exactly one thing: a pure-English block (ZERO Hangul + prose of
# _LOCALE_MIN_LEN+ chars on a ko-locale instance) is DROPPED whole, with a
# WARNING. There is no fragment-masking tier -- partial leaks (a tool name or
# internal path riding inside an otherwise-Korean body) are an UPSTREAM concern
# (the leader-summary layer), not the bridge's; the bridge deliberately keeps
# its hands off them. The guard return is exactly two-way: "" on a
# locale-register drop, else the text UNCHANGED.
#
# The locale rule is the machine enforcement of DESIGN-SYSTEM.md R2 (text
# register) doctrine: on a ko instance the user-facing register stays Korean,
# and a long all-English reply is the framework's working-English leaking into
# the user channel. Low-false-positive: fenced-code and bare-URL/deep-link
# lines are excluded from the scored prose (see _locale_register_prose), so a
# code-only or link-only reply never trips the drop.
#
# _register_findings still carries the DGN-430 fragment detectors (tool name /
# send_file:: marker / internal path / scheduler term) for the log-warn unit
# tests and any future upstream consumer, but the guard itself acts ONLY on the
# locale-register finding.

# the system prompt. Markdown @-chain loading cannot express this (vendor is a
# SESSION property, not a workspace property; @ includes are static and fail
# with exit 0 + empty stderr -- measured, DGN-1141-M2 section 2), so the
# contract must ride the spawner.
#
# Failure directions (DGN-1141-M2 section 3):
#   - vendors/ directory absent -> the vendor doc layer has not shipped yet
#     (pre-relayout instance): inject nothing, fail-OPEN. A session without a
#     vendor contract is the legitimate default, not an error.
#     Stage-5 decision (DGN-1141-M9): this carve-out is KEPT past the
#     template relayout -- live instances receive bridge code refreshes
#     BEFORE the update channel ships vendors/ (stage-6 copy-set entry), so
#     removing it here would boot-die every pre-migration instance on its
#     next update. Remove it in the SAME stage-6 commit that adds vendors/
#     to the update.sh copy set.
#   - vendors/ present but the DECLARED vendor's file missing/unreadable/empty
#     -> wiring error, fail-CLOSED: raise. The module-level validation call
#     below turns that into a bridge BOOT DIE (same seam as pydantic config
#     validation), observable in launchd logs -- never a silent contract-less
#     session, because doc-load failures are otherwise invisible.
#   - the DECLARED vendor's per-instance OVERLAY (vendors/custom.<name>.md,
#     DGN-818 C2) is OPTIONAL by construction: the name is instance-owned
#     (update.sh assert_instance_ownership_convention), so an operator may or

        the SDK delivers it (init SystemMessage / injected-turn result), instead

        Why: after a bridge restart the first turns are often INJECTED turns
        (cron-inject / session-inbox) that never produce a ChatResponse, so the
        turn-completion save path never runs and sessions.json keeps the OLD
        process's sid.  status-footer's _is_owner_session gate then stays closed
        and the workbench (dashboard.md) is never regenerated.

        Guard interplay (deliberate): this writes ONLY the on-disk value.  It
        must NOT touch bot._runtime_active_sessions -- that set is the
        cross-process guard in bot._effective_session_id which decides whether
        the persisted sid may be used as a RESUME target.  Membership is granted
        only by real turn completion / explicit resume in bot.py, so a fresh
        process still refuses to resume a previous process's session even
        though the disk value is now always fresh.

        Double-write with bot._save_session_id is harmless: same sid, and the
        dedupe marker (state.persisted_session_id) skips redundant disk writes.

        _get_or_create_stream, whose init-lock re-checks self._streams, so a

        (outbound-record, operator-alert) whose useful case is "the agent
        acts on the record", not "the agent narrates receipt to the owner".

        Returns False (caller retries later) when:

          reader loop, which attributes ALL output to pending[0] -- the

        """DGN-581: ESC-style soft interrupt of the in-flight turn.

        DGN-1016: `trigger` tags the interrupt origin in the INFO log
        ("stop" = explicit /stop command, "auto" = DGN-911 in-flight
        debounce). Before this tag the two origins were indistinguishable
        in the log, which is why the 2026-08-22 09:33 subagent-death
        incident could not be attributed. DGN-1499 adds "timeout" (the
        stop-before-kill path, _timeout_stop_then_preserve); it is the one
        trigger that changes behavior, and only in one detail: a grown fold
        is confirmed with the timeout caption instead of the stop caption,
        matching what handle_timeout_preserve stamps on the hard path.

        Sends the SDK control-protocol interrupt (ClaudeSDKClient.interrupt()
        -> Query.interrupt() -> control request {"subtype": "interrupt"}) so
        the current turn stops generating, while the stream state, the client
        connection, and the CLI subprocess all stay alive -- session context
        is preserved. Contrast stop(), which pops the stream state and tears
        the client (and, on timeout, the subprocess) down.

        DGN-991 caveat (measured): "the CLI subprocess stays alive" does NOT
        mean the turn's work survives. The CLI handles the interrupt control
        request by aborting the in-flight turn's AbortController tree, and
        in-session Task-tool subagents execute inside that tree -- so a soft
        interrupt kills them (2026-08-21 incident: soft interrupt only in the
        log, no hard kill, subagents dead). Work detached via
        dispatch-detached.sh runs in its own setsid session and is NOT
        killed by this path. Since the two coexist, the /stop reply
        (messages.STOP_INTERRUPTED) makes no blanket background-work claim
        either way (2026-09-03 owner decision, DGN-991); when tracked
        background work is confirmed dead by an AUTOMATIC interrupt,
        bg_task_killed_notice counts it (DGN-1593: not after /stop, and
        never by its internal description). Root fix (background
        work outside the session process) is the DGN-991 v2.0 relocation,
        out of scope here.

        Queue policy = DRAIN: every pending request for this user is resolved,
        not just the in-flight head, so no queued input auto-fires after the
        stop. Drafted bubbles of the interrupted turn are finalized in place
        (the same preserve path handle_timeout_preserve uses), and the drained
        futures resolve silently: empty content + streamed=True renders
        nothing at the bot reply layer, so the /stop acknowledgement is the
        only message the user sees.

        Returns False when there is nothing to interrupt: no live stream, no
        dispatched in-flight turn, a head turn that already ended and is
        being finalized (DGN-1819), or a client without a connected streaming
        query (interrupt() is only valid in streaming mode). The caller falls
        back to the legacy hard-stop semantics. Raises (e.g. TimeoutError,
        CLIConnectionError) when the interrupt send fails on a stuck turn so
        the caller can fall back to the hard teardown -- /stop must never
        degrade to a silent no-op.

        Concurrency: deliberately takes NO send_lock. The interrupt is a
        control-channel write the SDK serializes internally; waiting on
        send_lock here could deadlock behind the very dispatch this call is
        trying to interrupt.

        leaks a fact-only string with no button behind it). Nothing here
        restarts the bridge process: self_restart.sh's owner-notify contract
        is untouched by design.

        live stream, nothing dispatched, or the interrupt send failed / was
        not acked within INTERRUPT_SEND_TIMEOUT (the stuck-CLI case). The
