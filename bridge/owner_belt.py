"""Owner-send transport belt (DGN-1736 slice 0), OBSERVE mode.

Every in-process owner send -- message.reply_text, query.edit_message_text,
query.answer, bot.send_message in streaming / dashboard / countdown -- goes
through the one HTTPXRequest object installed with Application.builder()
.request(...). This module subclasses that transport on the same PTB seam
heartbeat.HeartbeatHTTPXRequest already uses (DGN-140) and inspects the
owner-visible text of each outbound request for bridge directive lines that
must never reach the owner: NO_PUSH, PUSH, [[OPTIONS...]], [[IDRILL:...]],
send_file::, link_preview:: and tool-call markup.

OBSERVE ONLY. A hit logs one "OWNER_BELT_HIT path=<endpoint> field=<name>
shape=<name>" line and the request is forwarded byte-identical: nothing is
stripped, dropped or raised. Any hit is a seat bug upstream (the send path
that produced it skipped a guard), to be filed, not tuned away here. An
enforcing mode is a separate, owner-noted change
(DGN-1736 delivery-seat design, section 4, slice 0).

Why only these shapes: at the transport the text is already rendered to
Telegram HTML. These directive lines survive rendering and HTML escaping
unchanged (tool-call markup arrives as "&lt;invoke"), so they are checkable
here. The machine-line gate, the leaked-tail strip and consumed-run
stripping must run pre-render (DGN-1209) and stay in the seat.

The scan is fence-blind on purpose: it judges what the owner would see, so a
code block that shows a directive line is reported too (observe cost: one
log line).

Out of scope: routines/push.sh is a separate process with its own HTTP
client and never reaches this transport (its python hop keeps its own
sanitize step). getUpdates keeps HeartbeatHTTPXRequest; it is inbound.
