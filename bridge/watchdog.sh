# bridge/watchdog.sh -- external polling watchdog (DGN-140, layer 2).
#
# Runs every ~2 minutes from launchd (macOS) or a systemd user timer (Linux).
# The bridge writes .telegram_bot/poll_heartbeat on every getUpdates round
# trip; when that file stops advancing, the bridge process is a zombie
# (alive, receiving nothing) and gets a full service restart.
#
# Two-strike design absorbs sleep/wake: the first run after wake sees a stale
# mtime and only ARMS a strike; the restart fires on a later run only if the
# heartbeat still has not advanced after a grace period. A recovered bridge
# advances the heartbeat between runs and the strike is cleared.

# ORDER IS SIMPLEST FIRST, per the owner's own sequencing. Step 1 needs only
# the phone he is already holding and works in the common case where the bot
# process is alive but wedged (the chat command is registered owner-only in
# bridge/bot.py, DGN-997). Step 2 needs no agent at all: the local launcher
